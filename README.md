## Abstract
Real-world data typically follow a long-tailed distribution, where a few majority categories occupy most of the data while most minority categories contain a limited number of samples. Classification models minimizing cross-entropy struggle to represent and classify the tail classes. Although the problem of learning unbiased classifiers has been well studied, methods for representing imbalanced data are under-explored. In this paper, we focus on representation learning for imbalanced data. Recently, supervised contrastive learning has shown promising performance on balanced data recently. However, through our theoretical analysis, we find that for long-tailed data, it fails to form a regular simplex which is an ideal geometric configuration for representation learning. To correct the optimization behavior of SCL and further improve the performance of long-tailed visual recognition, we propose a novel loss for balanced contrastive learning (BCL). Compared with SCL, we have two improvements in BCL: class-averaging, which balances the gradient contribution of negative classes; class-complement, which allows all classes to appear in every mini-batch. The proposed balanced contrastive learning (BCL) method satisfies the condition of forming a regular simplex and assists the optimization of cross-entropy. Equipped with BCL, the proposed two-branch framework can obtain a stronger feature representation and achieve competitive performance on long-tailed benchmark datasets such as CIFAR-10-LT, CIFAR-100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist2018.

## Requirement
- pytorch>=1.6.0
- torchvision
- tensorboardX

## Results and Pretrained Models
We provide three options for data augmentations of contrastive leanring branch: **sim-sim**, **sim-rand** and **rand-rand**. We use sim as the default data augmentation as in MoCo-V2, and rand as a stronger way to combine with RandAugment.

## Usage
For ImageNet-LT and iNaturalist 2018 training and evaluation. All experiments are conducted on 4 GPUs.
### ImageNet-LT 
To do supervised training with BCL for 90 epochs on ImageNet-LT with 4 gpus, run
```
python main.py --data /ImageDatasets/imagenet_2012 \
  --lr 0.1 -p 200 --epochs 90 \
  --arch resnet50 --use-norm True \
  --wd 5e-4 --cos True \
  --cl_views sim-sim
```
To run BCL with other augmentation stragey and models for contrastive learning branch, set `--cl_views sim-rand` or `--cl_views rand-rand` and ` --arch resnext50` .


To evaluate the performance on the test set, run
```
python main.py --data /ImageDatasets/imagenet_2012 \
  --arch resnet50 --use-norm True \
  --p 10 --reload True \
  --resume log/imagenet_resnet50_batchsize256_epochs_90_temp_0.07_lr_0.1_sim-sim/bcl_ckpt.best.pth.tar
```
### iNaturalist 2018 
To do supervised training with BCL for 100 epochs on iNaturalist 2018 with 4 gpus, run
```
python main.py --data /ImageDatasets/inat2018 \
  --lr 0.2 -p 200 --epochs 100 \
  --arch resnet50 --use-norm True \
  --wd 1e-4 --cos True \
  --cl_views sim-sim
```
